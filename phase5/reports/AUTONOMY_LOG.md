# Autonomous work log

## 2026-10-26 (IST) — R4B-AUTO WP1 and WP2 progress
1. Confirmed the active branch head matched the remote before work; prior R4B-1 content commit and green build remain intact.
2. The requested public source-ledger and map files were absent; used the supplied inventory/index notes and the repository claim ledger, without relying on filename-only evidence for claims.
3. Read the available source inventory notes and Tier-1 lookup; noted that some indexed records are absent from the accessible batches and that larger archives were not inspected. Brief page-snippet probes also touched one adjacent 2008 TPL article and a separate Tzou 1995 paper outside the ledger-mapped key; neither is used for a claim or manuscript citation.
4. Added docs/CSV-only path ignores to push and pull-request build triggers; the infrastructure commit is `abfa7f4`.
5. Self-audit for that commit: container build `40369202188` succeeded (130 pages; zero undefined references/citations, forbidden-tag matches, privacy matches, or near-overfull boxes).
6. WP1: added `evidence_mode` to all 442 ledger rows; all ten Class A rows now identify their evidence provenance.
7. Marked OCL-125, OCL-164, OCL-165, OCL-321, OCL-322, and OCL-326 as carried from the existing scientific audit; did not recast them as fresh reads.
8. Marked OCL-137, OCL-440, OCL-441, and OCL-442 as fresh source reads, with page/equation anchors cross-referenced to the findings report.
9. Working interpretation: no secondary backup branch is created from this session-bound checkout; no force push, deletion, publication, or external contact was performed.
10. WP1 is committed and pushed; Section 12 pre-commit audit passes (445 ledger rows, 13 Class A, no duplicate bibliography keys or missing citations, clean diff); local TeX tools are unavailable, so strict CI is the build gate.

## 2026-10-26 (IST) — WP2 Section 12 completed and audited
1. Freshly checked Chester (printed pp. 2014–2015), both distinct Guyer–Krumhansl papers, Chandrasekharaiah pp. 722–724, Dell’Oro–Pata’s first page, and Povstenko Eq. (29)/Appendix A.
2. Checked Tzou’s unified-field paper (printed p. 8) and Eq. (15)/(17) at p. 10; checked Quintanilla’s printed p. 713 identity and p. 720 strict stability/instability conditions.
3. Added only source-bounded Section 12 statements; no universal DPL criterion, Gamma-normalized Povstenko mapping, or cross-paper equation transfer was added.
4. Added `Quintanilla2003DPL` with the source-printed author initial and DOI; the 2019 MGT reference remains bibliography-only pending full-text review.
5. Added OCL-443–OCL-445; ledger is 445 rows (A=13, B=138, C=294), with all A rows retaining evidence provenance.
6. Added `MISSING_SOURCES.csv` entries for the unlocated Gorenflo/Mainardi records and Quintanilla 2019, explicitly limiting absence claims to indexed material.
7. Created local tag `R4B-AUTO-WP1` at commit `74ec8fa`; no backup branch was created because this session is branch-bound.
8. Committed and pushed Section 12 as `8afe364`; CI run `40372932181` passed with 130 pages, 0 undefined refs, 0 strict tag/privacy matches, and 0 near-overfull boxes.
9. Fast-forwarded output commit `720bcf2`; rendered-text spot-checks covered OCL-125, -137, -164, -165, -321, -322, -326, -440, -443, and -444, with OCL-445 checked separately.
10. Refreshed current README/build-status pointers; next is the dedicated Section 4 pass, where OCL-166–OCL-168 remain open pending claim-level disposition.

## 2026-10-26 (IST) — WP2 Section 4 Tzou subset
1. Visually checked Tzou (1995) printed p. 10 under “The Pure Phonon Field in Dielectric Crystals,” including Eqs. (15) and (17).
2. Confirmed Eq. (15)’s flux-gradient and scattering terms match the Section 4 equation; no Guyer–Krumhansl attribution was made.
3. Confirmed Eq. (17)’s three coefficient mappings and retained their paper-specific phonon scope.
4. Added printed-page anchors and direct citations to Section 4; made no equation or parameter correction.
5. Promoted OCL-166–OCL-168 to Class A with fresh page evidence; ledger remains 445 rows (A=16, B=135, C=294).
6. Expanded `MISSING_SOURCES.csv` for unavailable Section 4 sources; identity metadata remains separate from claim verification.
7. Committed and pushed the Section 4 content change as `6e43dda` on the session branch.
8. CI run `40374662081` passed: 130 pages, zero undefined refs, zero strict tag/privacy matches, zero near-overfull boxes.
9. Fast-forwarded output commit `511b754`; visually inspected p. 34 and checked extracted Section 12 text; CI reported no overfull boxes.
10. The Tzou subset is complete; other Section 4 sources remain open. Continue targeted Section 4 source checks before advancing to Section 5.

## 2026-10-27 (IST) — WP2 Section 5 targeted pass
1. Fast-forwarded the local session branch to remote `8b99e39`; confirmed the supplied worktree matched all tracked files except the five Section 5 edits, which were preserved.
2. Freshly read Biot (1956), printed pp. 241–242; Eq. (2.2) uses a negative temperature-increment stress term, while Eqs. (3.3)–(3.4) give the conductivity heat equation.
3. Freshly checked Mindlin (1974), pp. 625–626; the stated 3-D thermopiezoelectric balances, Fourier flux law, and electric-Gibbs constitutive equations support the baseline paragraph.
4. Checked Barak et al. (2023), p. 3; narrowed the table feature to the paper’s piezothermal-moduli and pyroelectric-constant nomenclature.
5. Checked Kumar et al. (2023), pp. 1 and 17; corrected the model family to dual-porous thermoelastic and kept the unity sum approximate, not exact.
6. Removed the unverified Gupta-specific interface claims; exact-source leads and bounded search limits are recorded in `MISSING_SOURCES.csv`.
7. Promoted OCL-195, -404, -405, and -207; removed OCL-205 and -206 from active text. Ledger is 445 rows (A=20, B=129, C=296); OCL-405 and -207 carry `CONTRADICTION-FIXED`.
8. Added targeted missing-source records for void, micropolar, and Gupta papers; did not inspect whole books or store private Drive identifiers or source PDFs.
9. `audit_inventory.py`, CSV uniqueness/count checks, and `git diff --check` pass; only Section 5 manuscript content and its reports/ledger changed.
10. CI run `40434775391` passed: 130 pages, zero undefined references/citations, forbidden tags/privacy matches, and near-overfull boxes; visually checked PDF pp. 40, 44–45. No backup branch was created under the fixed-branch constraint; WP2 remains incomplete, so no WP2 tag was made.
